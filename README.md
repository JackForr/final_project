# final_project

This project sought to answer the question of: How can we improve productivity
within Scotland and the UK overall? After initial planning and considering the current UK Economic context I focussed my attention on
deciding what would be my primary indicator of productivity. I settled on GDP/Capita/Hr Worked to allow for cross-country comparison
with different populations and working hours. As a subset of my productivity measure I investigated trends in the Uk's BoP and compared to other developed
nations. Based on this and countless other factors I undertook the ambitious goal of predicting future GDP in the UK and assessing what 
economic factors contribute hold the greatest predictive power in my model. This informed my recommendations for improving the UK's
stagnant productivity growth. I communicated these findings in a powerpoint presentation to my CodeClan Cohort.
